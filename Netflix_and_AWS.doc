The following diagram illustrates how the playback process works:
1. OCA’s periodically communicate health, routability, and content availability to the
cache control service.
2. A user on a client device requests playback of a title from the Netflix application.
3. The playback application services check user authorization and licensing, then
determine which specific streaming assets are required to handle the playback
request ­  taking individual client characteristics and current network conditions
into account.
4. The steering service uses the information stored by the cache control service to
pick OCAs that the requested video bits should be streamed from, generates
URLs for these OCAs, and hands the URLs over to the playback application
services.
5. The playback application services hand over URLs of the appropriate OCAs to
the client device, and video streaming starts.
